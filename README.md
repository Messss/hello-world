# hello-world
We'll see how this goes

My name is Mess (not really but I've grown attached to the word), I'm 18 years old and my dream is to someday in the near future create my very own game from scratch, something that people might love, something conceptually never seen before. I hope I can achieve my dream someday, and until then, I'll just, keep on trucking, I guess. 

Life can be pretty great, you know?
