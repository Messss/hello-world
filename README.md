# hello-world
We'll see how this goes

My name is Mess (not really but I've grown attached to the word), I'm 18 years old and my dream is to someday code, make music & art for and write my very own game, something that people might love, something conceptually never seen before. I hope I can achieve my dream someday, and until then, I know my friends have my back 100%. Cheesy, I know.
